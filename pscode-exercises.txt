// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)
ask for a number
divide by 2
check if remainder is 0 with % operator
true is even
false is odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

for loop through 5 numbers prompting user for input
add all numbers (avg = (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5))
avg = avg/5
initialize minimum and maximum int variables
set minimum and maximum to first number entered
use for loop to iterate through the input
if x < minimum set minimum to x
else if x > maximum set maximum to x
print avg to console with message " avg is the average of the 5 numbers entered"
print minimum and maximum to console with message " minimum is the smallest number entered while maximum is the largest number entered"
